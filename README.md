Machine Learning applications Feature Store implemented using hopeit.engine


## Are you interested?

[OCTOBER 2022: WE'VE JUST STARTED!]

The idea of this project is to implement a Feature Store
to store and serve feature for Machine Learning use cases
using micro services architecture in Python.

We'll combine implementation of endpoints, streams and event handlers
using [`hopeit.engine`](https://github.com/hopeit-git/hopeit.engine)

Here's a diagram of how the endpoints and events for the initial architecture:
